    <h2>Workshop details</h2>
    <p>
        Schwarzschild dynamical models, while successfully used for numerous scientific projects over the last 15 years, 
        were only recently used to model a large number of galaxies (first used for ~300 galaxies from the CALIFA survey, 
        ~150 from the MaNGA survey and ~160 from the SAMI surveys). With new data coming from state-of-the-art IFS surveys 
        such as MAGPI and HECTOR, being able to exploit all the information we can derive from good quality data is crucial. 
        DYNAMITE (DYnamics, Age and Metallicity Indicators Tracing Evolution) is a next generation implementation of the 
        Schwarzschild technique for orbit-based dynamical modelling of stellar systems. DYNAMITEâ€™s great versatility makes 
        it the perfect tool for a vast variety of projects and astronomical fields. This workshop will provide the tools to 
        enable scientists to use such a powerful technique in their research, maximising their research outputs.
        
        This website is a template that you could use for a (small) academic conference. 
        It&rsquo;s got a page for registration, where you can embed a Google Form or some other way for participants to register.
        It&rsquo;s got a program page to list the schedule for the conference.
        It&rsquo;s got a directions page to add a bunch of instructions how to get to the conference.
        It&rsquo;s got a page to put up the flyers and other promotional materials for folks to download.

    <h2>Organizers</h2>
    <p>
        Here&rsquo;s a good place to list the organizers and sponsors of the conference,
        as well as list contact information for the organizers,
        and show off the logos of the sponsors.
        It looks like his conference was sponsored by kittens!
